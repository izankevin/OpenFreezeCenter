# How To Install GUI app?
- Download the .zip from the github and extract it wherever you want.
- Open terminal inside the extracted folder and give the three .sh files sudo permissions with ```chmod +x root_permissions.sh``` , ```chmod +x install_deps.sh``` and ```chmod +x at_startup.sh```
- Run the root permissions file ```./root_permissions.sh```
